# Role-Playing Game (RPG) Character Management System

## Description
Develop a simple RPG character management system that demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming. The system should enable players to create characters, assign attributes, and manage their progression throughout the game.

## Classes

### Character
Create a class that represents an RPG character, including attributes such as name, level, health points (HP), experience points (XP), and abilities.
### Inventory
Implement a class that manages the inventory of the character, allowing them to add or remove items.
### BattleSystem
Design a class that simulates the battle system, enabling characters to fight against enemies and gain experience points and rewards.

## Features

1. Create a new character with a chosen class (e.g., warrior, mage, archer) and initial attributes.
2. Level up the character by gaining experience points through battles or completing quests.
3. Manage the inventory by adding or removing items such as weapons, armor, and potions.
4. Simulate battles between characters and enemies, with the ability to determine the outcome based on various attributes and abilities.
5. Display the character's current attributes and inventory.
6. Provide options for the character to use specific abilities or items during battles.
